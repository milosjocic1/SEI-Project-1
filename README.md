## Project 1 - Pong

# Game Description
Pong is a classic game where the player moves their bar on the right side of the screen vertically to try and hit an object past the opponent. The computer, in this
case (typically there is an option for a second player), moves its own bar on the left side of the screen and has the same objective. Each time the object in 
play goes past a player and hits the side of the window, a point is registered. First to 10 points wins!
